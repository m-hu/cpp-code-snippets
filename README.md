# cpp-code-snippets

## Introduction

- This repository aims at collecting frequently used algorithms for a software engineer's daily basis but implementing them in an easy to understand way.

- The repository contains only snippets, which means they are supposed to be adapted to specific use cases and to be implemented in a minimalist way focused only on algorithms themselves.

- Production related topic is not covered by this repository for the moment.

- Due to intellectual property reasons, the test cases are supposed to be found directly on the websites where the problems of code examples refer to.
