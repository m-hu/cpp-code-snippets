# cpp-code-snippets

## Introduction

- This repository aims at collecting frequently used algorithms for a software engineer's general knowledge but implementing them in an easy to understand way.

- The repository contains only snippets, which means they are supposed to be adapted to specific use cases and hence are implemented in a minimalist way focused only on algorithms themselves.

- Production related topic is not covered by this repository for the moment.

- In order to take into account content creators' interest, the test cases are supposed to be found directly on the websites where the problems of code examples refer to. The Jenkins pipeline used to run on my own infrastructure, for cost saving reason, I do no longer constantly run it. If it is requested or any enthusiasm comes back one day, I might reactivate it using an alternative infrastructure.
