# cpp-code-snippets

## Introduction

- This repository aims at collecting frequently used algorithms for a software engineer's general knowledge but implementing them in an easy to understand way.

- The repository contains only snippets, which means they are supposed to be adapted to specific use cases and hence are implemented in a minimalist way focused only on algorithms themselves.

- Production related topic is not covered by this repository for the moment.

- Due to intellectual property reasons, the test cases are supposed to be found directly on the websites where the problems of code examples refer to. The Jenkins pipeline used to run on my own infrastructure. Due to cost saving purpose I do no longer run it any more. If it is requested or any enthusiasm comes back one day, I might spend some of my time to run it again.
